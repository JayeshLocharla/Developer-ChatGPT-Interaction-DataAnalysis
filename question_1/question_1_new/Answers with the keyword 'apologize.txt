After being sick for a month at the beginning of February, we had three weeks of blissful health, then one thing after another came up. And as it happened, no sooner had one child recovered, the next was hit by something. Up to last week, we were healthy but sad due to the loss of our dear friend, and the strain of having to explain why an early death is sometimes not only a very personal tragedy but a great societal loss, as well. But two weeks ago, our two youngest children, each in turn, came down with the nastiest stomach bug that I think I have ever encountered in my 15+ years of parenting. Our 9-year-old daughter was completely incapacitated for two whole days and had to be hospitalized overnight, though she was the lucky one, by my calculations, as her brother (11) had it even worse than her, was down for about four days with fever, fatigue, and vomiting. It was very scary and had me and my wife feeling rather helpless. And of course, we quarantined ourselves to try to avoid getting it ourselves, but like clockwork, I got it a few days later and it totally laid me out. This was the sickest I have been in a long, long time.During this time, in an attempt to distract the kids from their physical pain and distress, I would pop on the television and let them watch their favorite YouTube series, \"Good Mythical Morning,\" which is this hilarious and weird show where two guys do various challenges and discuss bizarre topics while trying various foods and drinks and making fun of each other. I actually enjoyed the show quite a bit myself.And then a funny thing happened. I realized that I was starting to see the show while I was sitting in the same room with my daughter (usually while I was rubbing her back and trying to coax her into eating something), but I was also seeing the show when I was in other parts of the house--and my daughter wasn't even in the house! I would be in the kitchen fixing dinner, and suddenly, I'd have this sense of being in two places at once--watching the show and doing something else at the same time--and I could hear the dialogue and everything, but I knew my daughter wasn't there.The next time I went to pick up my daughter at school, I started to feel really strange when I got close to the school. Like my whole body was vibrating with this strange intensity. At first, I thought I was just being affected by the really strong espresso I had drank that morning, but the feeling was really growing stronger by the time I got to the school. It was so intense that I just had to sit in the car for a minute and catch my breath, which was coming really fast, like I had just run up a hill, even though I hadn't. After sitting for a moment, I realized that I was hearing the voice of the show inside my head--the familiar voice of Rhett McLaughlin.The intense sensation and the show in my head made me feel really dizzy, like I was floating up into the sky and my whole body was just light as air. And then suddenly, I wasn't in my car anymore. I was on the other side of the school grounds, where the old baseball field used to be. And there, not far from where I stood, were Rhett and Link.I stared at them for a moment, shocked and amazed and almost afraid, because I had no idea how they got there or why they would be at my daughter's school. They were just standing there, looking at me, not saying anything, not even smiling or anything. It was just the strangest thing I had ever experienced, and I didn't know what to do or say.Finally, I managed to find my voice and asked, \"What are you doing here?\"Rhett and Link looked at each other and then back at me, and then Rhett said, \"We've come to help you.\"\"Help me? With what?\"\"With the writing. We've come to help you with the writing.\"\"The writing?\"\"Yes, the writing. We've been watching you, you know. We've been following your blog for years. We've seen the struggles you've had with your writing, the ups and downs, the triumphs and the failures. We know how much you love it, how much it means to you. And we want to help.\"I was stunned. I mean, these were the guys I had watched on YouTube for years, the ones who had inspired me to start my own blog in the first place. And now here they were, telling me that they wanted to help me with my writing.\"But why? Why me?\" I asked.\"Because we believe in you. We believe in your talent and your passion. We see the potential in you, and we want to help you reach it. We've been working on a new project, and we think you would be perfect for it. We want you to be a part of it.\"\"What kind of project?\"\"A book. A book about life, about love, about the big questions and the small moments. A book that will make people think and feel and maybe even change their lives. We want you to write it.\"I was overwhelmed. I mean, I had always dreamed of writing a book, but I never thought it would actually happen. And now here were Rhett and Link, offering me the opportunity of a lifetime.\"Are you serious?\" I asked, my voice barely a whisper.\"Yes, we are serious,\""
