Developer-ChatGPT-Interaction-DataAnalysis. MSR Mining Challenge. Data Used: https://github.com/NAIST-SE/DevGPT

We have addressed three questions in this project.

Question 1: How can we identify and analyze gaps in ChatGPT's knowledge, particularly focusing on questions it cannot answer?

Question 2: If developers were to rerun their prompts with ChatGPT now and/or with different settings, would they obtain the same results?

Question 3: What kind of inquiries do developers typically pose to ChatGPT, in terms of code blocks or conversation blocks?
