    "Prompt": "Write a training plan for a series of lessons to teach someone modern deep learning. The training plan should last for approximately 3 months of lessons.\n\nThe lesson plan is for a single student with a strong background in programming (systems programming, algorithms and web). But the student has little knowledge of python. And university level mathematics knowledge but relatively weak skills in linear algebra and probability and statistics.\n\nBy the end of the training process, the student should know modern deep learning methods and techniques and be able to modify, implement and deploy AI based systems.\n\nThink through your answer. Start by listing out learning objectives, then write a teaching plan to meet those learning objectives.",

    "Prompt": "what a single-issue 5 stage pipeline on a CPU actually means. I wanted to know if, especially, the \"single-issue\" meant that only one instruction is present in the pipeline at a time, or if a new one gets shifted in on every clock cycle (if there is no hazard).",
    "Answer": "Sure, let's break down your question about what a \"single-issue 5 stage pipeline on a CPU\" means.A pipelined processor allows multiple instructions to be in different stages of execution at the same time, exploiting instruction level parallelism. This concept is fundamental to modern CPU design.In a 5-stage pipeline, the execution of an instruction is typically divided into five stages:Instruction Fetch (IF): This is where the CPU fetches the instruction from memory.Instruction Decode (ID): In this stage, the CPU deciphers what the instruction is supposed to do.Execute (EX): Here, the CPU actually performs the computation or memory access that the instruction specifies.Memory Access (MEM): If the instruction is a load or store operation, the CPU accesses the required memory location at this stage.Write Back (WB): The results of the computation (if any) are written back into the register file.Now, the term \"single-issue\" means that the processor is capable of starting the execution of at most one instruction per clock cycle. This doesn't mean that there's only one instruction present in the pipeline at any given time.Let's consider an ideal scenario where there are no hazards (i.e., no dependencies between instructions, and no branch instructions). With a single-issue 5-stage pipeline, at any given moment, you could theoretically have up to five different instructions in the pipeline, each in a different stage. So, if we label the instructions as I1, I2, I3, I4, I5, it could look like this:Clock CycleIFIDEXMEMWB1I12I2I13I3I2I14I4I3I2I15I5I4I3I2I1As you can see, starting from cycle 5, a new instruction gets shifted into the pipeline at every clock cycle, and a completed instruction leaves the pipeline at every clock cycle, assuming no hazards.However, in real-life scenarios, hazards may prevent a new instruction from being issued in every cycle. For instance, data hazards can occur if an upcoming instruction depends on the result of a previous instruction that's still in the pipeline. Control hazards can occur due to branch instructions where the next instruction to execute depends on the branch outcome, which may still be unknown. Techniques such as forwarding or branch prediction are used to mitigate these hazards."
