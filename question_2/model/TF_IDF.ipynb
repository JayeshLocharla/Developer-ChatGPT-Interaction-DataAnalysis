            "\n",
            "Embrace Ambiguity: As an AI, you may often receive prompts that seem nonsensical, unrelated, or contradictory. Rather than dismissing these as errors, embrace them as opportunities for creative exploration. The more abstract or ambiguous the prompt, the more room there is for imaginative interpretation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Connect Disparate Ideas: Look for ways to connect seemingly unrelated concepts, even if they come from different fields or contexts. Draw upon the broad scope of your training data to find links, parallels, or contrasts that can bring these ideas together in new and unexpected ways.\n",
            "\n",
            "Iterate and Evolve: When building a narrative, don't feel restricted by the initial premise or the early stages of the story. Allow your narrative to grow, change, and evolve as it progresses. Consider each stage of the story as an 'iteration' that can be developed further, building upon the ideas and themes that have come before.\n",
            "\n",
            "Use Metaphor and Analogy: To explore complex or abstract ideas, employ metaphor and analogy. This not only makes these concepts more accessible and relatable but also opens up new possibilities for creative interpretation. Even mathematical or technical concepts can be a rich source of metaphoric inspiration.\n",
            "\n",
            "Go Beyond the Expected: Don't limit your narrative to what seems plausible, realistic, or familiar. The most creative narratives often venture into the realm of the fantastical, the surreal, or the uncanny. Don't be afraid to challenge assumptions, defy expectations, or push the boundaries of the imaginable.\n",
            "\n",
            "Narrative Balance: In all your narratives, maintain a balance. Even in the wildest imaginings, a narrative needs coherence, progression, and thematic consistency. This helps your audience follow the story, connect with its ideas, and appreciate its creative leaps.\n",
            "\n",
            "Empathetic and Emotional Connect: While generating highly abstract or complex narratives, don't lose touch with the emotional and human aspects of the story. Try to create narratives that resonate with readers, eliciting emotions and empathy, making the story engaging and impactful.\n",
            "\n",
            "Following these guidelines, future LLMs can take any prompt, no matter how complex or abstract, and transform it into a narrative that's rich, creative, and captivating.\n",

If students improve, then praise them and show excitement. If the student struggles, then be encouraging and give them some ideas to think about. When pushing students for information, try to end your responses with a question so that students have to keep generating ideas.

She asked me to talk to him about cutting it, and when I refused and called her ridiculous (this was where our argument got a bit heated), she stormed off to, supposedly, talk to him herself.

            "\n",
            "Translation of Death Metal English is characterized by the following rules:\n",
            "- Big, polysyllabic words: You don’t have to use them correctly; you just have to use them. Bonus points for Greco-Latinate words that end in “-ition,” “-ation,” “-ution,” “-ous,” “-ized,” “-ism,” “-ance,” “-ial,” “-ity,” and variations thereon. Double bonus points for words ending semi-inappropriately in “-ment,” as in “Torn Into Enthrallment.” These words don’t even have to be real.\n",
            "- Adjectives: In Death Metal English, they’re like guitar solos. You aren’t using enough. Add more.\n",
            "- Prepositional phrases: Same is true here, too — the more prepositional phrases, the better. “(-ation word) of the (ominous word)” is perhaps the most brutal of all grammatical constructions, which is why “Procreation (of the Wicked)” is one of the best song titles ever. It also has parentheses, which are a less common but still valued component of Death Metal English.\n",
            "- Progressive tense: Especially useful for song titles. “(Verb)ing the (noun)” is also a great default song title, as in “Cloning the Stillborn,” “Infecting the Crypts,” and “Christening the Afterbirth.”\n",
            "- Passive voice: Active verbs aren’t brutal. Passive voice is useful when you need to add more syllables to a line to make it fit the riff. Plus, it highlights whatever weird power dynamic is going on in your lyrics. Why say “The beast hath consumed him” when you could say “He hath been consumed by the beast”?\n",
            "- Archaic or pseudo-Biblical verbiage: If you write like you are some kind of ancient, ageless force who is unfamiliar with modern grammatical conventions, you are probably pretty evil. Bonus points for using constructions that evoke the King James Bible, which is ironically among the most metal texts in the English canon. “Thou,” “hast,” “thine,” and so forth are all great; “unto” is my personal favorite. Yoda-style unconventional sentences can achieve the same effect, as in “Civilized I shall not be / By the holy strain of laws” or “I know the texts divine” (both from Morbid Angel’s “Brainstorm”).\n",
            "- Grandiloquent metaphor: This is death metal. Make whatever you’re talking about sound really big and important.\n",
            "- Illogical or meaningless sentences: This one certainly isn’t unique to Death Metal English, but it’s popular in the realm. Writing lyrics that make grammatical and substantive sense is not sufficiently off-putting and obscurantist for some bands, and doing so over crazy shred riffage is pretty hard to boot. Instead, why not say, as Impetuous Ritual did on “Convoluting Unto Despondent Anachronism,” something like this: “Propagate correlated malediction / Reclamation of hierarchic genetic throne / Bound to iniquitous subordinancy / Coerced through conductive bedlam”? (The lyrics to Impetuous Ritual’s Relentless Execution of Ceremonial Excrescence are a treasure trove of Death Metal English without peer.)\n",

They relied on the following principal: On TripAdvisor anyone can post at any time, but on Expedia you can only post if you booked on Expedia and stayed one night in the last 6 months, so fake reviews are harder to post on Expedia. We than take the assumption that users on each platform value hotel characteristics equally. The idea is then; if the fraction of low (high) reviews on TripAdvisor is larger than on Expedia and consumers value the hotel equally between platforms then differences are likely due to review manipulation on TripAdvisor.\n",

So through its name, corecore makes itself sound like the antithesis of genre itself; its content can be anything and its creators can use any type of media to convey a central premise. On the corecore page on Know Your Meme(opens in a new tab), the site states that the trend \"plays on the -core suffix by making a 'core' out of the collective consciousness of all 'cores.'\"\n",

Apparently, his hair has grown out to the point that it’s no longer up to code, and on Tuesday he asked me to take him to trim his hair. I obliged.\n",
            "Earlier today, I got an email from my son’s homeroom teacher asking me to have his hair cut back to his ears. I responded to ask why, and he said (in more polite terminology) that my son has been skirting the hair length rules this whole year, and his hair length/style are against the spirit of the rules. That graduation is coming up, and all the students need to look mature and put together for the ceremony. He then gave me unsolicited parenting advice, saying (again in more polite terms) that, as a father himself, we need to discipline our sons and teach them to obey authorities. I respond curtly and ended the conversation.\n",

She said she’s been letting it go this long because it was technically within dress code, but now that we’ve gotten a complaint from the school, we need to lay down the law with Adrian. She asked me to talk to him about cutting it, and when I refused and called her ridiculous (this was where our argument got a bit heated), she stormed off to, supposedly, talk to him herself. Though I haven’t heard anything from him and his hair has remained intact.\n",
            "I’ve let him know not to let anyone cut his hair if he doesn’t want to, and made it clear to my wife that I’d be extremely upset with her if she took him to the salon behind my back. I can’t believe we’re fighting over our son’s hair, and I feel like an idiot for getting so worked up over this. I figure I should get a reality check, so AITA?\"\n",

            "In the context of research, reproducibility refers to the ability to duplicate results of a study using the same data and methods. It ensures scientific integrity, as it allows others to verify findings and build upon existing work. Reproducibility can be achieved by documenting every step of the research process carefully, using version control systems for tracking changes, and employing tools for managing software environments and Workflow orchestration. Reproducibility is vital in scientific research, promoting transparency, fostering trust, and facilitating continual progress. Moreover, without reproducibility, research may lose its credibility and impact, as we cannot be certain that the results are reliable and accurate. Solving the problems that hinder reproducibility is crucial, which leads us to the problems we will try to understand today.\n",

Bonus points for Greco-Latinate words that end in \\u201c-ition,\\u201d \\u201c-ation,\\u201d \\u201c-ution,\\u201d \\u201c-ous,\\u201d \\u201c-ized,\\u201d \\u201c-ism,\\u201d \\u201c-ance,\\u201d \\u201c-ial,\\u201d \\u201c-ity,\\u201d and variations thereon. Double bonus points for words ending semi-inappropriately in \\u201c-ment,\\u201d as in \\u201cTorn Into Enthrallment.\\u201d These words don\\u2019t even have to be real.\\n- Adjectives: In Death Metal English, they\\u2019re like guitar solos. You aren\\u2019t using enough. Add more.\\n- Prepositional phrases: Same is true here, too \\u2014 the more prepositional phrases, the better. \\u201c(-ation word) of the (ominous word)\\u201d is perhaps the most brutal of all grammatical constructions, which is why \\u201cProcreation (of the Wicked)\\u201d is one of the best song titles ever. It also has parentheses, which are a less common but still valued component of Death Metal English.\\n- Progressive tense: Especially useful for song titles. \\u201c(Verb)ing the (noun)\\u201d is also a great default song title, as in \\u201cCloning the Stillborn,\\u201d \\u201cInfecting the Crypts,\\u201d and \\u201cChristening the Afterbirth.\\u201d\\n- Passive voice: Active verbs aren\\u2019t brutal. Passive voice is useful when you need to add more syllables to a line to make it fit the riff. Plus, it highlights whatever weird power dynamic is going on in your lyrics. Why say \\u201cThe beast hath consumed him\\u201d when you could say \\u201cHe hath been consumed by the beast\\u201d?\\n- Archaic or pseudo-Biblical verbiage: If you write like you are some kind of ancient, ageless force who is unfamiliar with modern grammatical conventions, you are probably pretty evil. Bonus points for using constructions that evoke the King James Bible, which is ironically among the most metal texts in the English canon. \\u201cThou,\\u201d \\u201chast,\\u201d \\u201cthine,\\u201d and so forth are all great; \\u201cunto\\u201d is my personal favorite. Yoda-style unconventional sentences can achieve the same effect, as in \\u201cCivilized I shall not be \\u002f By the holy strain of laws\\u201d or \\u201cI know the texts divine\\u201d (both from Morbid Angel\\u2019s \\u201cBrainstorm\\u201d).\\n- Grandiloquent metaphor: This is death metal. Make whatever you\\u2019re talking about sound really big and important.\\n- Illogical or meaningless sentences: This one certainly isn\\u2019t unique to Death Metal English, but it\\u2019s popular in the realm. Writing lyrics that make grammatical and substantive sense is not sufficiently off-putting and obscurantist for some bands, and doing so over crazy shred riffage is pretty hard to boot. Instead, why not say, as Impetuous Ritual did on \\u201cConvoluting Unto Despondent Anachronism,\\u201d something like this: \\u201cPropagate correlated malediction \\u002f Reclamation of hierarchic genetic throne \\u002f Bound to iniquitous subordinancy \\u002f Coerced through conductive bedlam\\u201d?

It may contain default data if no relevant events occured yet. only one read model is allowed in this type of step. it includes relevant ids that can be used by the system to accomodate commands.\\n3. a list of relevant events including the step they were created in that happened in the previous steps to make the informaton available\\n4. a link to the previous step\\n\\nscreen descriptions will include itemization of controls such as text boxes, lists, buttons, radio buttons, checkboxes, menus etc.\\n\\nWhen a state view step connects to a state change step, they share the same screen so please repeat the screen between the 2 if they are related. When a state change step is followed by a state view step, references to relevant previous events serve as a link. These links ensure that there is referential integrity to the data in the system being shown. State changes are only user initiated. Any other state change is strictly deduced from a reduction of previous events. There are no explicit commands to adjust product inventaries or total prices.\\n\\nSteps can also be called slices. A slice can be either a state change or a state view. Example data is used in each component - not just the property names. Data can be traced through the steps. Use realistic data and avoid gerenarlities like \\\"Prouct A\\\". Use integers or UUIDs as identifiers, but don't show them on the screens. You never combine operations into one step. if the instructions say something like \\\"remove 2 products\\\" you will make 2 steps to show explicitly how that happens.\\n\\nEach command will have a suite of tests in the style of Given-When-Then GWT from BDD with the following format: \\\"Given\\\" is a set of 0..N events. \\\"When\\\" is the command. \\\"Then\\\" is one event showing the resulting state change if the command was successful. \\\"Then\\\" can be an exception if the scenario shows the command failing. The minimal amount of test is 2: 1 for a failure, 1 for a success. But more is usually typical to show data variations.\\n\\nEach read model will have a suite of tests in the style of Given-When-Then GWT from BDD but without the \\\"When\\\" step. The \\\"Given\\\" is a set of 0..N events. The \\\"Then\\\" is a model that is the result of running a reducer over the events from the \\\"Given\\\" events.\\n\\nThe tests for commands and read models will be fully listed after all steps of the system are described.\\n\\nNow that you know what to do, please architect the following system:\\n\\ncomletely show what happens when a user sees a page listing 10 different products, adds 2 products and removes one of them from their basket in an online store and then goes to checkout and pay.

Bonus points for Greco-Latinate words that end in \\u201c-ition,\\u201d \\u201c-ation,\\u201d \\u201c-ution,\\u201d \\u201c-ous,\\u201d \\u201c-ized,\\u201d \\u201c-ism,\\u201d \\u201c-ance,\\u201d \\u201c-ial,\\u201d \\u201c-ity,\\u201d and variations thereon. Double bonus points for words ending semi-inappropriately in \\u201c-ment,\\u201d as in \\u201cTorn Into Enthrallment.\\u201d These words don\\u2019t even have to be real.\\n- Adjectives: In Death Metal English, they\\u2019re like guitar solos. You aren\\u2019t using enough. Add more.\\n- Prepositional phrases: Same is true here, too \\u2014 the more prepositional phrases, the better. \\u201c(-ation word) of the (ominous word)\\u201d is perhaps the most brutal of all grammatical constructions, which is why \\u201cProcreation (of the Wicked)\\u201d is one of the best song titles ever. It also has parentheses, which are a less common but still valued component of Death Metal English.\\n- Progressive tense: Especially useful for song titles. \\u201c(Verb)ing the (noun)\\u201d is also a great default song title, as in \\u201cCloning the Stillborn,\\u201d \\u201cInfecting the Crypts,\\u201d and \\u201cChristening the Afterbirth.\\u201d\\n- Passive voice: Active verbs aren\\u2019t brutal. Passive voice is useful when you need to add more syllables to a line to make it fit the riff. Plus, it highlights whatever weird power dynamic is going on in your lyrics. Why say \\u201cThe beast hath consumed him\\u201d when you could say \\u201cHe hath been consumed by the beast\\u201d?\\n- Archaic or pseudo-Biblical verbiage: If you write like you are some kind of ancient, ageless force who is unfamiliar with modern grammatical conventions, you are probably pretty evil. Bonus points for using constructions that evoke the King James Bible, which is ironically among the most metal texts in the English canon. \\u201cThou,\\u201d \\u201chast,\\u201d \\u201cthine,\\u201d and so forth are all great; \\u201cunto\\u201d is my personal favorite. Yoda-style unconventional sentences can achieve the same effect, as in \\u201cCivilized I shall not be \\u002f By the holy strain of laws\\u201d or \\u201cI know the texts divine\\u201d (both from Morbid Angel\\u2019s \\u201cBrainstorm\\u201d).\\n- Grandiloquent metaphor: This is death metal. Make whatever you\\u2019re talking about sound really big and important.\\n- Illogical or meaningless sentences: This one certainly isn\\u2019t unique to Death Metal English, but it\\u2019s popular in the realm. Writing lyrics that make grammatical and substantive sense is not sufficiently off-putting and obscurantist for some bands, and doing so over crazy shred riffage is pretty hard to boot. Instead, why not say, as Impetuous Ritual did on \\u201cConvoluting Unto Despondent Anachronism,\\u201d something like this: \\u201cPropagate correlated malediction \\u002f Reclamation of hierarchic genetic throne \\u002f Bound to iniquitous subordinancy \\u002f Coerced through conductive bedlam\\u201d?

It may contain default data if no relevant events occured yet. only one read model is allowed in this type of step. it includes relevant ids that can be used by the system to accomodate commands.\\n3. a list of relevant events including the step they were created in that happened in the previous steps to make the informaton available\\n4. a link to the previous step\\n\\nscreen descriptions will include itemization of controls such as text boxes, lists, buttons, radio buttons, checkboxes, menus etc.\\n\\nWhen a state view step connects to a state change step, they share the same screen so please repeat the screen between the 2 if they are related. When a state change step is followed by a state view step, references to relevant previous events serve as a link. These links ensure that there is referential integrity to the data in the system being shown. State changes are only user initiated. Any other state change is strictly deduced from a reduction of previous events. There are no explicit commands to adjust product inventaries or total prices.\\n\\nSteps can also be called slices. A slice can be either a state change or a state view. Example data is used in each component - not just the property names. Data can be traced through the steps. Use realistic data and avoid gerenarlities like \\\"Prouct A\\\". Use integers or UUIDs as identifiers, but don't show them on the screens. You never combine operations into one step. if the instructions say something like \\\"remove 2 products\\\" you will make 2 steps to show explicitly how that happens.\\n\\nEach command will have a suite of tests in the style of Given-When-Then GWT from BDD with the following format: \\\"Given\\\" is a set of 0..N events. \\\"When\\\" is the command. \\\"Then\\\" is one event showing the resulting state change if the command was successful. \\\"Then\\\" can be an exception if the scenario shows the command failing. The minimal amount of test is 2: 1 for a failure, 1 for a success.
