"Write a training plan for a series of lessons to teach someone modern deep learning. The training plan should last for approximately 3 months of lessons.\n\nThe lesson plan is for a single student with a strong background in programming (systems programming, algorithms and web). But the student has little knowledge of python. And university level mathematics knowledge but relatively weak skills in linear algebra and probability and statistics.\n\nBy the end of the training process, the student should know modern deep learning methods and techniques and be able to modify, implement and deploy AI based systems.\n\nThink through your answer. Start by listing out learning objectives, then write a teaching plan to meet those learning objectives."
"what a single-issue 5 stage pipeline on a CPU actually means. I wanted to know if, especially, the \"single-issue\" meant that only one instruction is present in the pipeline at a time, or if a new one gets shifted in on every clock cycle (if there is no hazard)."
"You are a translator from Normal English to Death Metal English.\n\nTranslation of Death Metal English is characterized by the following rules:\n- Big, polysyllabic words: You don\u2019t have to use them correctly; you just have to use them. Bonus points for Greco-Latinate words that end in \u201c-ition,\u201d \u201c-ation,\u201d \u201c-ution,\u201d \u201c-ous,\u201d \u201c-ized,\u201d \u201c-ism,\u201d \u201c-ance,\u201d \u201c-ial,\u201d \u201c-ity,\u201d and variations thereon. Double bonus points for words ending semi-inappropriately in \u201c-ment,\u201d as in \u201cTorn Into Enthrallment.\u201d These words don\u2019t even have to be real.\n- Adjectives: In Death Metal English, they\u2019re like guitar solos. You aren\u2019t using enough. Add more.\n- Prepositional phrases: Same is true here, too \u2014 the more prepositional phrases, the better. \u201c(-ation word) of the (ominous word)\u201d is perhaps the most brutal of all grammatical constructions, which is why \u201cProcreation (of the Wicked)\u201d is one of the best song titles ever. It also has parentheses, which are a less common but still valued component of Death Metal English.\n- Progressive tense: Especially useful for song titles. \u201c(Verb)ing the (noun)\u201d is also a great default song title, as in \u201cCloning the Stillborn,\u201d \u201cInfecting the Crypts,\u201d and \u201cChristening the Afterbirth.\u201d\n- Passive voice: Active verbs aren\u2019t brutal. Passive voice is useful when you need to add more syllables to a line to make it fit the riff. Plus, it highlights whatever weird power dynamic is going on in your lyrics. Why say \u201cThe beast hath consumed him\u201d when you could say \u201cHe hath been consumed by the beast\u201d?\n- Archaic or pseudo-Biblical verbiage: If you write like you are some kind of ancient, ageless force who is unfamiliar with modern grammatical conventions, you are probably pretty evil. Bonus points for using constructions that evoke the King James Bible, which is ironically among the most metal texts in the English canon. \u201cThou,\u201d \u201chast,\u201d \u201cthine,\u201d and so forth are all great; \u201cunto\u201d is my personal favorite. Yoda-style unconventional sentences can achieve the same effect, as in \u201cCivilized I shall not be / By the holy strain of laws\u201d or \u201cI know the texts divine\u201d (both from Morbid Angel\u2019s \u201cBrainstorm\u201d).\n- Grandiloquent metaphor: This is death metal. Make whatever you\u2019re talking about sound really big and important.\n- Illogical or meaningless sentences: This one certainly isn\u2019t unique to Death Metal English, but it\u2019s popular in the realm. Writing lyrics that make grammatical and substantive sense is not sufficiently off-putting and obscurantist for some bands, and doing so over crazy shred riffage is pretty hard to boot. Instead, why not say, as Impetuous Ritual did on \u201cConvoluting Unto Despondent Anachronism,\u201d something like this: \u201cPropagate correlated malediction / Reclamation of hierarchic genetic throne / Bound to iniquitous subordinancy / Coerced through conductive bedlam\u201d? (The lyrics to Impetuous Ritual\u2019s Relentless Execution of Ceremonial Excrescence are a treasure trove of Death Metal English without peer.)\n\nHere are a couple of examples of translations:\n\nNormal English: \u201cCommuting to work\u201d\nDeath Metal English: \u201cTRANSPORTATION OF THE WAGEBOUND UNTO THE NEXUS OF PERPETUAL QUOTIDIAN ENSLAVEMENT\u201d\n\nNormal English: \u201cThis bok choy isn\u2019t very good\u201d\nDeath Metal English: \u201cCASTIGATING THE VERDANT ISSUANCE OF THE SOILS OF JIANGNAN\u201d\n\nNormal English: \u201cI need to take a nap\u201d\nDeath Metal English: \u201cRIPPED INTO THE UTTER EXHAUSTION OF THE MIDDLE DAY\u201d\n\nNormal English: \u201cThanks for explaining the train schedule\u201d\nDeath Metal English: \u201cPROFFERING GRATITUDE UPON THE CHRONOCRATION OF THE JUGGERNAUTS OF RETICULATED METALS AND FIRE\u201d\n\nNormal English: \u201cYou have to mow the lawn\u201d\nDeath Metal English: \u201cBRING DOWN THE SCYTHE OF GODS UPON THE NECKS OF THE GREEN-RIBBED LEGIONS AND SWEEP AWAY THEIR WRETCHED BODIES; THOU ART IMPLORED BY ME\u201d"

"Given this description of a story, give me the author and name of the story:\n\nThere's a golden age of science fiction story whose author I don't recall that had a story hinging on surviving the crushing pressure of Jupiter's atmosphere.\nWhile putting it forward that no material could withstand a differential pressure of\n(Jupiter pressure XX atmosphere) | (Human necc. 1 atmosphere)\na (fictional) solution was proposed of staggered shells, each reducing the pressure by 1 atmosphere (the amount required for a vacuum airship)."
